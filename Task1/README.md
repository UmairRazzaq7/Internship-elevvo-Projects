# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis
## 📌 Overview
This project explores the Kaggle Titanic dataset to understand what factors influenced passenger survival during the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
🐍 Python

📊 Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation

📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn  for visualization

## 📋 Steps Followed
### 1️⃣ Data Loading
🔹 Loaded the dataset using Pandas
🔹 Previewed the structure and data types

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
🔧 Handled missing values (like Age, Cabin, and Embarked)
🔧 Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📊 Visualized survival patterns based on:

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Gender : Higher survival rate for females

🎟️ Passenger Class (Pclass) : 1st class had better chances

📅 Age Groups : Age binned into categories like Child, Teen, Adult

💡 Used count plots, histograms, and bar charts to observe trends

🔥 Created a heatmap to compare survival by Gender & Class

## 🎯 Key Findings
✅ Females were more likely to survive
✅ 1st class passengers had a higher survival rate
✅ Children and young adults had better chances compared to older adults
✅ Combining Gender + Class gives deeper insight into survival odds

## 📌 Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how data science and visualization can uncover patterns from historical data. It’s a powerful way to extract insights and tell a compelling story 📖 through numbers.
